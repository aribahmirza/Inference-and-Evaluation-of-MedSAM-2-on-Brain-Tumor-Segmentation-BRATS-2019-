# Inference-and-Evaluation-of-MedSAM-2-on-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-BRATS-2019-
This task aims to explore and evaluate the performance of MedSAM-2 for medical image segmentation using the BRATS 2019 dataset. MedSAM-2 reframes 2D/3D segmentation as a video object tracking task . The end goal is to gain insights into its generalization capability, especially in segmenting brain tumor subregions.
